Generate commission free online bookings directly on your Wordpress site by integrating the igumbi online booking tool.

== Description ==

igumbi is a simple and fast online booking tool / online booking engine (also an online hotelsoftware / PMS and a revenue- / yield-management system).

The plugin makes the booking tool available to your Wordpress site. You will use the igumbi backend to handle your daily business and reservations, send emails via email-templates like offers and confirmations, create invoices, assign rooms, check in and register your guests.

igumbi gives your site visitors dynamic room/apartment prices based on revenue management methods, which also implement an upselling strategy. This will help you, as the property owner, to earn more and pay less OTA comissions. 

The plugin is free to use, but you do [need an account](http://www.igumbi.com/trial) with igumbi.com.
